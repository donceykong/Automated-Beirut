# Automated-Beirut
This is a project my CSU mechatronics team and I made for our class. It is an Arduino- and PIC-controlled, automated game of beruit (beer pong, basically).This project uses no fluids in the cups and there is only one team that can play at a time. Attached is the Arduino IDE software I wrote to get the game working.
